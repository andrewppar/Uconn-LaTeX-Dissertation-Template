\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{graphicx}
%\graphicspath{ {Images/} } %This specifies the path where any images can be found. If you have any images in any chapters then make a directory in the same directory as this file called Images and put those images in it.

%These are the packages I use to create hyperlinks in the document. If you want to reference another part of the document, e.g. Section 2, in the code put

% \section{TITLE} 
% \label{sec:title}
% 
% where section 2 is in the .tex file. To reference section 2 and create a hyperlink use \cref{sec:title}, or \Cref{sec:title} to capitalize. This will also create links in the bibliography to the places where each work is cited. This behavior and the color of the links can be altered by changing the corresponding options in the first line.
